[Whoppy](https://github.com/huntermacd/whoppy) is a project by [Wray Bowling](https://github.com/wraybowling) and [Hunter MacDermut](https://github.com/huntermacd) exploring the Web Audio API. [Whoppy v2](https://github.com/huntermacd/whoppy-v2) is the updated version leveraging newer technologies and with an improved user interface. Touch stuff! Have fun!

### What is it?

You'd be hard-pressed to find a person without a touchscreen phone in their pocket. Whoppy is meant to transform that phone into an instrument that anyone can play, even those without musical experience or understanding.

### Tools

- [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) - provides interface for creating and synthesizing sound waves on the web
- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) - allows for building apps with web technologies, then creating a native build to leverage native UI
